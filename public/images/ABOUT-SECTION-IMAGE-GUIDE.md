## üí° Export Tips

### For Best Quality:

1. **Use 2x or 3x scale**
   - 2x = 800-1200px width (good for most screens)
   - 3x = 1200-1800px width (best for 4K displays)

2. **Include the perspective**
   - The phone should be tilted/angled (3D view)
   - Include the shadow for depth
   - Keep the natural perspective from the design

3. **Screen content**
   - Make sure the case list is visible
   - All text should be readable
   - Purple header should be clear

4. **Background**
   - Export with transparent background if possible
   - Or include the subtle shadow/gradient from Figma
