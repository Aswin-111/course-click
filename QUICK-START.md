# ✅ Court Click Website - Quick Start

## 🎉 Your Website is Ready!

The Court Click website has been successfully built and is currently running.

## 🌐 Access Your Website

**Your website is now live at:**
- **http://localhost:3001** (Primary)
- or http://localhost:3000 (if port 3001 doesn't work)

## 📸 Images Status

✅ I can see you have `landing.png` in the `public/images/` folder - this is the full Figma design!

The website I built matches this design. The page currently uses placeholder images for the phone mockups. To add the actual images:

### Option 1: Use the Full Landing Image (Quick)
If you want to display the full landing page as a single image temporarily:
```tsx
// Replace the entire page.tsx content with:
<img src="/images/landing.png" alt="Court Click" className="w-full" />
```

### Option 2: Export Individual Assets from Figma (Recommended)
Export these specific images from Figma:
1. `hero-phone-mockup.png` - Hero section phone
2. `phone-mockup-2.png` - Middle section phone
3. `mobile-app-preview.png` - Maroon card phone

Place them in `public/images/` and the website will automatically use them.
