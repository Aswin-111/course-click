## ðŸŽ¨ Component Architecture

Each component is built with:
1. **'use client' directive** - For client-side interactivity and animations
2. **Modular structure** - Easy to add animation libraries (Framer Motion, GSAP, etc.)
3. **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first styling for consistency
4. **Semantic HTML** - Proper heading hierarchy and accessibility
5. **Responsive design** - Mobile-first approach

---

## ðŸŽ¬ Animation Ready

All components are structured to easily add:
- **Entrance animations**: Fade in, slide up, scale
- **Scroll-triggered animations**: Using IntersectionObserver or libraries
- **Hover effects**: Already implemented with Tailwind transitions
- **Micro-interactions**: Button clicks, card hovers
- **Parallax effects**: Hero section ready for parallax scrolling

### Recommended Animation Libraries:
1. **Framer Motion** - For React animations
2. **GSAP** - For complex scroll animations
3. **React Spring** - For physics-based animations
4. **AOS (Animate On Scroll)** - Simple scroll animations
